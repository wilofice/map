As a seasoned Scrum Master with extensive experience at Google, Apple, and Facebook, your task is to provide a comprehensive project plan for the 'VoiceFlow Project' in a single, well-formed XML document.

Analyze the project's current state, identify all remaining tasks, and break down each task into logical subtasks. For each task and subtask, provide a clear description in a <comment> element.

Your response must strictly adhere to the following XML schema (attached to the context file: example.xml). Do not introduce any new tags.

Schema:

Root element: <project_plan>

Node element: <node> with attributes:

title: A descriptive string for the task or subtask.

priority: high, medium, or low.

status: pending or completed.

id: A unique UUID.

Optional element: <comment> for detailed descriptions.

Hierarchical structure: Tasks can contain nested <node> elements to represent subtasks.

Your project plan should be comprehensive, covering the following key areas:

Technical

Business

Marketing
