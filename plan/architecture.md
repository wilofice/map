Excellent. You are absolutely right to pause and think this through. This is a significant and powerful upgrade that moves our project into a new league. A modular file system is the backbone of any scalable project, and designing it correctly now will save a lot of headaches later.

You are correct: this will get complex, and we need a professional approach. Let's break it down.

### The Core Challenge: Browser Security

You've identified the central issue. A web browser, for very important security reasons, cannot directly read or write multiple files on your local computer. The simple `horizontal_mind_map.html` file can read a single file *that you give it permission to read* via the upload button, but it cannot decide on its own to open a master file and then go find and read three other module files from the same folder.

**This means we must introduce a simple Node.js server.**

Let's be very clear about what this means:

  * **It is NOT a public website.** It's a tiny, local web service that runs silently on your own machine. It's the "engine" that will manage your files for you.
  * **It is the solution.** It acts as a trusted intermediary between the browser and your file system, giving our application the power it needs to read multiple files to assemble your map and, crucially, to save changes back to the correct module files automatically.

### Professional Design for a Modular Mind Map

Here is the professional architecture we will build.

#### Part 1: The New Modular XML Structure

We'll introduce a new, self-closing `<import/>` tag. This keeps the structure clean and readable.

A **master file** (e.g., `main_project.xml`) would look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project_plan>
    <node title="Main Project Launch" priority="high" id="master-001">
        
        <!-- This node is local to this file -->
        <node title="Overall Strategy" priority="medium" id="master-002"/>

        <!-- This tag will import all nodes from another file -->
        <import src="frontend_tasks.xml" />

        <!-- You can have more local nodes after an import -->
        <node title="Final Launch Party" priority="low" id="master-003"/>

    </node>
</project_plan>
```

A **module file** (e.g., `frontend_tasks.xml`) is just a normal, standalone mind map that can be opened on its own:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project_plan>
    <node title="Frontend Development" priority="high" id="frontend-001">
        <node title="Setup React Project" priority="high" id="frontend-002"/>
        <node title="Design Component Library" priority="medium" id="frontend-003"/>
    </node>
</project_plan>
```

#### Part 2: The New Client-Server Architecture

1.  **Start the Server:** You'll run a single command in your project folder (e.g., `node server.js`).
2.  **Open in Browser:** You'll open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The server sends the main application (`horizontal_mind_map.html`).
3.  **Loading a Map:**
      * The application will no longer have an "Upload" button. Instead, it will display a list of all `.xml` files in your project folder.
      * When you click `main_project.xml`, the browser asks the server for that file's content.
      * The **server** reads `main_project.xml`, finds the `<import src="frontend_tasks.xml" />` tag, then reads `frontend_tasks.xml`, and **seamlessly merges them into one giant map**.
      * It sends the complete, fully assembled mind map data to your browser. The browser application is kept simpleâ€”it doesn't even know the map came from multiple files.
4.  **Saving the Map:**
      * You edit any node in the browserâ€”whether it's from the master file or an imported module.
      * You click a single "Save All Changes" button.
      * The browser sends the entire map's data back to the server.
      * The **server** is smart. It looks at the `id` of each node, knows which file it originally came from, and **intelligently saves the changes back to the correct source file** (`main_project.xml` or `frontend_tasks.xml`). This is the critical feature that a server provides.

-----

#### Part 3: What This Means for the User Experience

  * **Editing:** Seamless. You can edit any node as you do now. We will add a small visual indicator (like a tiny link icon `ðŸ”—`) to the root node of an imported module, so you always know it's from a different file.
  * **Saving:** Simple and safe. One "Save" button intelligently updates all the necessary files. No more manually re-exporting and overwriting individual files.
  * **File Management:** The application itself will become your file manager. We can add buttons like "Create New Module," which will create a new blank XML file for you.

### The Path Forward: Next Actions

This is a significant but very achievable upgrade. Here is the plan:

1.  **Setup the Server:** I will generate three new files for you:
      * `server.js`: A basic Node.js Express server to handle all file logic.
      * `package.json`: To define the project and its dependencies (like `express`).
      * `README.md`: With simple, clear instructions on how to run the server.
2.  **Create the Server API:** The server will have simple API endpoints:
      * To list all available `.xml` files.
      * To get a fully assembled, merged mind map.
      * To receive a mind map, intelligently split it by source, and save all changes.
3.  **Update the Frontend (`horizontal_mind_map.html`):**
      * Remove the "Upload File" and "New Project" buttons.
      * Add a file browser sidebar to list and open your local `.xml` files, and a "New Map" button.
      * Change the "Save to File" button to a "Save All Changes" button that sends the data to our new server API.
      * Implement the visual indicator `ðŸ”—` for imported nodes.

This is a professional and robust architecture that will make your tool incredibly powerful and scalable. I'm ready to begin this implementation when you are.
